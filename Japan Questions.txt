10. Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual - miscalculation average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.


SELECT CAST(CEILING(AVG(CAST(SALARY AS DECIMAL)) - AVG(CAST(REPLACE(SALARY, 0, '') AS DECIMAL))) AS INTEGER) FROM EMPLOYEES;

NOTE:- Here we used CAST, CEILING and REPLACE functions 
	CAST is used to convert the datatype into other datatype
	CEILING is used to round of the decimal to nearest number
	REPLACE is used to replace the current one with previous one





11. We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary X months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total
